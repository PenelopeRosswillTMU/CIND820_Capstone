Tentative stages of the project: 
  -Problem solve ways of combining the blocks into one dataset without making the file too large
  -see what additional feature selection tools are available for categorical datasets
  -

Repository Guide
  -EDA HTML Reports: the reports generated based on the complete dataset "EDA Report.HTML", and then the 4 blocks of data created to make the multiple selection id duplication manageable "EDA Report_block1-5.HTML"
  -the original dataset from the survey and the 4 separated blocks, in csv format.
