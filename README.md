# CIND820_Capstone

## Tentative stages of the project: 
  - Problem solve ways of combining the blocks into one dataset without making the file too large
  - re run analyses with combined dataset
  - see what additional feature selection tools are available for categorical datasets
  - decide which variables are best to use for modelling and answering research questions
  - run all analyses using the decided variables
  - Create confusion matrix for the classification methods used
  - create presentation documents 

## Repository Guide
  - EDA HTML Reports: the reports generated based on the complete dataset "EDA Report.HTML", and then the 4 blocks of data created to make the multiple selection id duplication manageable "EDA Report_block1-5.HTML"
  - the original dataset from the survey and the 4 separated blocks, in csv format.
  - ipynb files for the EDA reports and code for the feature selection on block 1 (chi squared and mutual information)
  - results of the feature selection process
  - table of the accuracy scores for each variable that would potentially be used as output variables from block 1

## Research Questions
-	What intersections of identity impact LGBTQ+ Canadians need and use of social services? 
-	Do the intersections of identity correlate with specific use of social services? 
-	How does physical location in relation to the centers offering social services impact participation?
-	Does the success of a certain social program vary on the identity of the person using them? 
-	Does income and education affect the use of social services?
